## Introduction

Class related files for a certain class taught by Dr. S. The class and professor are intentionally kept vague to prevent homework answers and projects from being publically searchable, but also allow Grading Assistants and Dr. S to see my work.

## Running/evaluating homework files

To run a homework problem, first, `cd` into the relevant directory or navigate with MATLAB to set the right homework folder as your working directory. Then run the homework problems as standalone MATLAB script. For some of these \*.m files, you might need to add the files in the `scripts` directory to your MATLAB path (run `help path` in MATLAB for more information).

Each homework file is well-commented, and should include references to various tables used to justify values, and a clear description of the units of each variable if applicable.

Homework scripts are not intended to be be complete on their own, and often reference pen-and-paper work that describes how various quantities are measured or defined. They are primarily used to ensure calculations are done reliably, and are easy to adjust should I notice an error in my process.

## Compiling project one (FEA) slideshow

Install LaTeX, and compile the script. You may need to install the Gotham theme. Alternatively, you can simply comment out the theme line, which will change the look of the final presentation, but not its content or general layout.
