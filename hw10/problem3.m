%% Functions

% print_and_validate
% 
% Intended to print outputs in an aligned fashion directly applicable to the homework answer.
% Intended to be aesthetically pleasing, ended up kind of wonky, but oh well.
%
% If given a proper range (i.e. when Dr. Sargent includes bounds on a homework answer), this 
%   method can be used to validate and provide an obvious warning if values given are outside 
%   of this range. This behavior can be easily disabled.
% 
%
% Inputs:
% - name -- a string or character array containing the name of the variable.
%       - Must be 1 characters or less
% - val -- the value of the variable in question
%       - can be a double, any integer type, string, or character (array)
%       - will disable validation if it's of type string or char
% - units -- a string or character array representing the name of the units val is in 
%       - Must be 4 characters or less
% - range_low -- a double that contains the lower range value to check against 
%       - must match units of val
%       - set to NaN to disable all range checking (high and low)
%       - ignored if val is type string or char
%
% - range_high -- a double that contains the upper range value to check against 
%       - must match units of val
%       - set to NaN to disable all range checking (high and low)
%       - ignored if val is type string or char
%
% Side Effects:
%   - prints out formatted text indicating the value (and units) of the given variable
%   - 
%
% Throws/Assertations:
%   - assert fails when val is outside range_low and range_high (inclusive), but only if
%       - neither range_low nor range_high are NaN
%       - val is of type double
%
function print_and_validate(name, val, units, range_low, range_high)
    % Run `help strcmp` or `doc strcmp` for more info
    if (strcmp(class(val), 'string') || strcmp(class(val), 'char'))
        fprintf("%-1s = %-3s %-4s\n", name, val, units);
        return;
    end
    
    if (contains(class(val), "int"))
        % done instead of %i to avoid leading zero's
        fprintf("%-1s = %-3s %-4s\n", name, string(val), units);
    else
        % format as double
        fprintf("%-1s = %-3.3f %-4s\n", name, val, units);
    end
    
    % Check if range is NaN, if not, proceed with range checking
    if (~sum(isnan([range_low range_high])))
        assert(val >= range_low && val <= range_high, name + " is outside valid range given in"...
            + " problem statement. Manual intervention is required. Good luck.");
    end
